Welcome to NEAT-Python's documentation!
=======================================

:abbr:`NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)` is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural
networks. NEAT-Python is a pure Python implementation of NEAT, with no dependencies other than the Python standard library.

Currently this library supports Python versions 3.6 through 3.11, as well as PyPy 3.

Many thanks to the original authors of this implementation, Cesar Gomes Miguel, Carolina Feher da Silva, and Marcio Lobo Netto!

.. note::
  Some of the example code has other dependencies. For your convenience there is a conda environment YAML file in the
  examples directory you can use to set up an environment that will support all of the current examples.
  TODO: Improve README.md file information for the examples.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see `Selected Publications
<http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications>`_ on Stanley's website, or his recent `AMA on Reddit
