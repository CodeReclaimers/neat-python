## About ##

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method for evolving arbitrary neural networks developed by Kenneth O. Stanley. This project aims to implement NEAT in the Python programming language.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please visit: [Selected Publications](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications) in Stanley's website.

## Getting Started ##

If you want to try neat-python, please check out the repositor, start playing with the XOR example and then follow creating your own experiment.
