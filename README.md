## About ##

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural
networks. This project is a pure-Python implementation of NEAT with no dependencies beyond the standard library. It was
forked from the excellent project by @MattKallada.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see the [publications page](https://www.kenstanley.net/papers) of Stanley's current website.

`neat-python` is licensed under the [3-clause BSD license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).  It is
currently only supported on Python 3.6 through 3.14, and pypy3.

## Getting Started ##

If you want to try neat-python, please check out the repository, start playing with the examples (`examples/xor` is
a good place to start) and then try creating your own experiment.

The documentation is available on [Read The Docs](http://neat-python.readthedocs.io).
