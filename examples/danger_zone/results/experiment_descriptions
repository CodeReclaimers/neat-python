Time steps = 150

SM_free_2

Same as SM_free_1 but with double the simulation time (300 timesteps)
and probabilities of adding a transition much lower (p = 0.1)

SM_free_1

Starting from one state expanding, with a maximum of 5 states.
Diversion criteria is the number of states. Meaning the species are grouped by number of states.

SM_2_states

State machine with 2 states and no conditions initially.
(SM_fixed_layout, but then without the transition)

NEAT

Reference implementation in NEAT.
A single neural network without any states.
Findings: Network always goes forward faster and faster until at the end, but then reward is already gone.
