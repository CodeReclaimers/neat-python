## neat-python examples ##

Note that there is a significant amount of duplication between these scripts, and this is intentional.  The goal is to 
make it easier to see what the example is doing, without making the user dig through a bunch of code that is not 
directly related to the NEAT library usage.

## The examples ##

* `circuits` Uses an external circuit simulator (PySpice) to create electronic circuits that reproduce an arbitrary function of the input voltage.

* `memory-fixed` Reproduce a fixed-length sequence of binary inputs.    

* `memory-variable` Reproduce a variable-length sequence of binary inputs.

* `picture2d` Generate 2D color or grayscale images using Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks.

* `single-pole-balancing` Balance a pole on top of a movable cart.
